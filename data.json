The video contrains a slowly changing background with two classes of objects moving from top to bottom. Class one consists of large, square, red objects, and class two consists of small, circular, blue objects. The size, speed and brightness of color are drawn at random from normal distributions. All frames are injected with random noise to simulate a real-world video stream.
