{"id_vid": "htuLf76Ze-g", "title": "Why Did Makima Kill Power?ü§î #shorts #makima #chainsawman", "views": 491125, "duration": 56, "description": "As more and more fans transition from the Chainsaw Man anime series to Tatsuki Fujimoto‚Äôs original manga, they find themselves speed-reading up to weekly releases. While not inherently negative, this often leads to major developments or plot points being misinterpreted or missed altogether.\n\nOne such plot point which many new Chainsaw Man manga fans have been asking about centers around Makima and Power. At one point, much later in the manga series, Power is killed by Makima‚Äôs hand, and in an incredibly brutal fashion, no less.\n\nWith the shock of this death and the events that immediately follow, many fans don't seem to have picked up on exactly why Makima chose to kill Power. As such, this article will discuss why Makima decides to kill Power and the latter's ultimate fate in Chainsaw Man.\n\nFollowing the events of the Gun Devil arc, Denji and Power find themselves being forced to move into a new apartment, with Aki‚Äôs residence having been destroyed in his and the Chainsaw Man's fight. Meanwhile, Denji is wrestling with the realization that he killed Aki, even if his former senior-turned-friend was a mindless fiend by that point.\n\nOne night, Denji finds himself at Makima‚Äôs apartment, discussing how he feels and finally being asked what his request to her is. Rather than requesting to get physically intimate with Makima, as he had planned earlier in the story, he asks to become her dog instead. Denji's reasoning for doing so is that he doesn‚Äôt want to make decisions for himself anymore since he always feels bad afterward.\n\nMakima accepts. After trivializing the matter by having Denji ‚Äúdo tricks,‚Äù she tells him that the ring at the door is Power, and after he opens the door, she will kill her. Despite being shocked by her words, Denji eventually acquiesces as Makima‚Äôs latest obedient dog, opening the door to see Power standing with a cake since that day is Denji‚Äôs 17th birthday.\n\nHowever, Chainsaw Man manga then sees Makima use her Force Manipulation powers to shoot Power, obliterating every part of her body above her waist and below her neck. Upon going back inside her apartment, Denji asks Makima if he‚Äôs dreaming, prompting her to begin laughing uncontrollably.\n\nShe then explains that Denji‚Äôs ‚Äúpromise‚Äù with Pochita was actually a contract and that her goal was to break the same. Makima implies that the best way to do this was to make Denji ‚Äúso hurt that [he‚Äôd] no longer be capable of living a normal life‚Ä¶ never be able to bounce back for as long as [he] live[d].‚Äù\n\nShe shares that she began by making Denji a lot happier, giving him a job, money, delicious food, and a family in the form of Aki and Power. Essentially, she orchestrated the prior events of Chainsaw Man for this purpose. Makima even made this level of happiness Denji's new normal before ripping it all away from him and destroying everything he came to love about his new life.\n\nWhile Power dies here, she makes one last appearance before Part 1 of the manga series comes to its end. Shortly after her death, Makima manipulates the now contract-less Denji into transforming into the true form of Chainsaw Man, i.e., the Chainsaw Devil. After a long fight, she eventually kills the Chainsaw Devil‚Äôs true form, and presumably Denji as well.\n\nHowever, Pochita awakens Power via the blood she made Denji drink earlier in the series. He asks Power to save the blond protagonist for him, to which she agrees, causing her to jump out of the Chainsaw Devil‚Äôs true form into the Blood Devil‚Äôs true form. She then takes Denji to a dumpster, where their consciences talk as he recovers. However, Power‚Äôs conscience and body are gone when Denji awakens, cementing her death.\n\nChainsaw Man sees Makima kill Power in order to take away Denji‚Äôs new level of happiness, thus breaking the contract Denji had with Pochita. While she does reappear briefly to save Denji‚Äôs life in his time of need, it is implied that she truly died at Makima‚Äôs hands and merely used what little strength was in her blood that Denji drank to come back as a Devil briefly.\n________________ \nStay Connected ‚û†\nüìå Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/itsanidiction/\nüìå Website - https://mikianime.com/ \n________________ \n‚ß´ Chainsaw man makima kills power\n‚ß´ Why did makima kill power\n‚ß´ Chainsaw man power death\n‚ß´ Power death chainsaw man anime\n‚ß´ The reason why makima killed power", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htuLf76Ze-g"},

As her natural appearance is nearly identical to that of a human, she avoids disclosing her Devil nature to most of her underlings, and spends much of the series posing as a human contracted to a Devil rather than a Devil herself. However, this is only a fa√ßade that she uses to fulfill her ultimate goal: After the death of Aki Hayakawa, Makima begins to reveal her true colors to Denji. Makima's true face is of someone that is Machiavellian, calculating, who sees people around her as nothing more than \"dogs\" she can use as she much as she likes and must obey her without any hesitation.\n\nMakima has demonstrated to be extremely cunning, cold and manipulative. She controls Denji through the promises of a romantic and sexual relationship while also threatening him with extermination if he disobeys her. Ruthless and normally dispassionate, she will do whatever it takes to reach her goals, even at the cost of the people she should be protecting.\n\nMakima also realizes that she is not a good person and deems herself as \"necessary evil\"; a weapon under control of Japanese government, just like Gun Devil which is under control of Americans. She is not afraid of her plans derailing, since whether her plans fail or succeed, she will achieve something she wants.\n\nMakima is an extreme fan of Chainsaw Man, the \"Hero of Hell\". Fascinated by its ability to wipe out the embodied concept of a devil through consuming them, her stated goal is to bring Chainsaw Man under her control in order to use its abilities to create an ideal world without fear, death, and ‚Äúbad‚Äù movies. However, failure is also acceptable, as it would mean being eaten‚Äîan honor according to her.\n\nMakima's true goal was to be together forever with Pochita and lead a happy life with him. She always yearned for something like a family, being incapable of forming equal and meaningful relationships as the Control Devil.\n________________\nStay Connected ‚û†\nüìå Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/itsanidiction/\nüìå Website - https://myanimeverse.com/ \n________________\n‚ß´ Why makima want pochita\n‚ß´ Why makima want to kill denji\n‚ß´ Why does makima want the chainsaw devil\n‚ß´ Why makima want to kill chainsaw man\n‚ß´ Chainsaw man pochita powers", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a42jS2Yi-hg"},
